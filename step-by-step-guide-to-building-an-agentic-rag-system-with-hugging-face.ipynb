        "## Introduction\nIn today's AI-driven world, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are pivotal in enhancing the capabilities of language models by integrating retrieval mechanisms for more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This tutorial will guide you through building a scalable, production-ready RAG system using Hugging Face's SmolAgents library. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have the skills to design and implement a RAG system that can be deployed in real-world applications, leveraging the power of generative AI.\n\n## Installation\nTo get started, we'll need to install the necessary libraries. Open a new Google Colab notebook and run the following command to install the required packages:"
