        "You probably use agent frameworks like LangChain or BabyAGI without really seeing how they work under the hood. This tutorial is your chance to peel back the layers. You're going to build a ReAct\\-style agent from scratch. This will help you understand what AI agents fundamentally are, how they reason, act, and loop with tools—all without any third\\-party framework. When you see how each part works, you'll understand more clearly what those frameworks are doing for you.\n\nThe core idea comes from the paper \"ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models\" (arXiv:2210\\.03629\\) by Yao et al. ReAct shows that you can get better performance and interpretability when a model both reasons (writes thoughts) and acts (calls tools), weaving those steps together with observations.\n\n## Introduction\n\nBuilding an agent that can reason, call tools, and iterate without supervision is now straightforward—if you control the format, validate the inputs, and guard against runaway loops. This tutorial shows you how to build a ReAct agent from scratch using the OpenAI Python SDK, three simple tools (distance lookup, travel time calculation, sum), a regex\\-based action parser, and a single\\-action\\-per\\-turn control loop with a max\\-turn guard. You'll end with a runnable, testable agent that can answer multi\\-step questions like \"How long to drive from Montreal to Boston at 60 mph?\"\n\n**Prerequisites:** Python 3\\.10\\+, an OpenAI API key, and basic familiarity with LLMs. Token usage is minimal. Using gpt\\-4o\\-mini for tool lookups keeps costs low. This tutorial is Colab\\-ready and starts with a `!pip install` cell.\n\n## Why This Approach Works\n\nFrameworks add convenience—but they hide behavior. If you build things from scratch, you gain complete control. You can debug faster. You'll know exactly when and why the model does something.\n\n**Why GPT\\-4o and GPT\\-4o\\-mini?**GPT\\-4o provides strong reasoning for the main agent loop. GPT\\-4o\\-mini handles simple tool lookups cheaply and quickly. The combination keeps cost and latency balanced without losing reliability.\n\n**Why ReAct?**The ReAct pattern (Reason \\+ Act) forces the model to articulate its reasoning before taking action. That makes behavior interpretable and easier to debug. A strict format—Thought → Action → PAUSE → Observation—lets you parse and validate every step programmatically.\n\n**Why regex parsing?**Regex is deterministic, fast, and transparent. You know exactly what matches and what doesn't. For production, you could swap in JSON\\-based arguments or the OpenAI function\\-call API. Regex is a simple way to start.\n\n## How It Works (High\\-Level Overview)\n\n1. **Agent receives a question**, then generates a Thought and an Action. Example: `lookup_distance[Montreal, Boston]`.\n2. **Control loop parses the Action** using regex, validates it, and calls its Python function.\n3. **Tool returns a result** (e.g., \"308 miles\"), which becomes the Observation.\n4. **Agent updates reasoning** with the new info. It either calls another tool or gives a final Answer.\n5. **Loop stops** once the agent outputs `Answer:` or hits the max turn limit.\n\n## Setup \\& Installation\n\nRun this cell in Colab or your local environment to install dependencies:"

Reasoning lets the model plan. Actions let it get grounded information. Observations let it correct and update what it thought.\n* ReAct outperforms reasoning\\-only (Chain\\-of\\-Thought) and acting\\-only approaches on tasks like HotpotQA and FEVER. It reduces hallucinations and error propagation by using external sources.\n* Its format is similar here: Thought → Action → Observation → Thought → … → Answer. That gives you both interpretability and control.\n* You'll see in the frameworks you already use that they adopt very similar contracts: they make you define tool signatures, control loops, stopping criteria, etc. This tutorial reproduces those pieces explicitly so you can see them.\n\nYou're now set up to experiment, tweak formats, add tools, or change the logic. Doing this by hand teaches you what the frameworks automate. That knowledge will make you a better builder, better debugger, and better decision\\-maker about which abstractions to introduce."
