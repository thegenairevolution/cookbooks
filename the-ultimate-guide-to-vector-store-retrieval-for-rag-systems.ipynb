        "Retrieval Augmented Generation (or RAG, as everyone calls it) is one of those design patterns that actually delivers on its promise. I've seen it power everything from customer support chatbots to internal knowledge assistants. The best part? It tackles that persistent problem we all face with LLMs. It grounds their responses in real information, which dramatically cuts down on hallucinations.\n\nRAG is the backbone of data\\-aware chatbots and support tools everywhere. If you want to see how this works in practice, I put together a tutorial on building a [multi\\-agent chatbot with ChromaDB RAG](/article/how-to-build-a-multi-agent-chatbot-with-crewai-chromadb-gradio-4) that shows the whole process end to end.\n\nNow, RAG has two main components: retrieval and generation. This guide focuses on RAG 101, specifically the retrieval part. We're going to zero in on finding the right context for your model. You'll build an index, search through it, first manually to really understand what's happening, then using LangChain to speed things up. Once you've got retrieval down, plugging the results into your LLM is straightforward.\n\nThe retrieval process is really the heart of what we're doing here. It's all about finding and selecting the most relevant documents for your use case. There are several approaches you can take, but vector store retrieval has become the go\\-to method for most applications.\n\nLet me walk you through the two essential retrieval steps. First, you'll create the index. Then you'll search it. I want you to see the mechanics clearly, so we'll do it manually first. After that, I'll show you how LangChain makes the whole process much smoother.\n\n## Semantic Similarity Search Done Manually\n\nSemantic Similarity Search is probably the most widely used retrieval approach out there. The idea is simple: find documents that best match your input based on meaning, not just keywords. This approach really shines when you need to match semantic content across text. Say you have a user query and you want to find the most relevant sentences or paragraphs in your documentation. It's particularly powerful for retrieving internal knowledge to enhance customer support or adding grounded context to LLM responses.\n\nWe're going to implement Semantic Similarity Search manually using Sentence Transformers for embeddings and ChromaDB as our vector store. If you're curious about [how transformer models generate embeddings](/article/transformers-demystifying-the-magic-behind-large-language-models-2) and why they work so well for semantic search, I've written a detailed guide that explains the underlying mechanics.\n\n## Setup\n\nBefore diving in, let's get the required Python libraries installed. Here's what we'll use:\n\n* **chromadb**: A fast and efficient vector database that's become my go\\-to choice\n* **sentence\\-transformers**: For generating sentence embeddings\n* **PyPDF**: A modern library for reading and processing PDF files\n* **langchain**: The framework for building LLM\\-powered applications\n* **langchain\\-community**: Extensions and integrations for LangChain\n* **langchain\\-huggingface**: Tools to use Hugging Face models within LangChain\n\nBy the way, if you're interested in [integrating LLMs into your Python workflow](/article/how-to-boost-workflow-with-llm-pair-programming-in-jupyter-ai-2) for tasks beyond retrieval, I've found some practical techniques for LLM pair programming in Jupyter AI that might help."

You've learned how to create an index by processing and embedding documents, and how to search that index to find relevant information based on queries. We worked through both methods using the Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee. The manual path gave you transparency and control, while the LangChain path showed how abstraction can save time and simplify your workflows.\n\nYou're now ready to apply retrieval in your own applications.
