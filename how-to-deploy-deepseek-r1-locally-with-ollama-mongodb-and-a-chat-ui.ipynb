        "So you've probably heard about DeepSeek R1 by now, that open source large language model from the Chinese startup DeepSeek. The release made headlines and actually managed to spook the U.S. stock market, with several AI stocks taking a hit. Look, there are already tons of reviews out there telling you how impressive this model is, so I won't pile on. What I want to talk about instead is something actually useful. You can download this thing and run it on your own machine. For a quick primer on the foundations behind models like R1, [see how transformer architectures power large language models like DeepSeek R1\\.](/article/transformers-demystifying-the-magic-behind-large-language-models-2)\n\nWhy would you want to do that? Well, maybe you're not comfortable sending your data to some third party API. Or maybe you're trying to keep costs under control. I've been there. Running locally means you can fine tune the model and customize everything to fit your specific stack. Plus, you can learn [how in\\-context learning techniques can further boost your model's accuracy and control](/article/the-magic-of-in-context-learning-teach-your-llm-on-the-fly-3).\n\nHere's the good news. Getting DeepSeek R1 running on your own hardware is actually pretty straightforward. Let me walk you through exactly how I did it.\n\n## Get a machine: AWS EC2 instance\n\nFirst things first, you need a machine to run DeepSeek R1\\. If you're just experimenting or building a personal chatbot, honestly, your local computer might be enough. But if you're thinking about production, you'll probably want dedicated servers. And if you just want to get started quickly without any fuss, a cloud instance is your fastest bet.\n\nFor a lightweight start, an AWS EC2 CPU instance will handle the 1\\.5B parameter variant just fine. When I first tested this, I used an m5\\.2xlarge. You can still use that one. But actually, you might want to consider newer generation instances like m7i.2xlarge or m7g.2xlarge for better price performance. I've noticed the newer ones run cooler too.\n\nNow, if you want faster responses or you're planning to try the larger variants, go with a GPU instance. A g6\\.xlarge or g5\\.xlarge makes a good baseline. These give you an NVIDIA GPU with enough VRAM to handle 7B class models at practical quantization levels. Trust me, the speed difference is worth it if you're doing anything beyond basic testing.\n\nTo launch an EC2 instance, just follow the official AWS guide: [AWS EC2 Getting Started Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)\n\n## Set up your machine\n\nNext, you'll need to install the essentials to run DeepSeek R1\\. I always start with a fresh Ubuntu LTS image to keep things clean. Ubuntu 24\\.04 LTS is what I'm using these days, works great.\n\nConnect to your instance over SSH using AWS's official steps: [Connecting to Your Linux Instance Using SSH](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/connect-linux-inst-ssh.html)\n\n### Install dependencies"

        "## Download and serve DeepSeek R1 on Ollama\n\nAlright, time to choose your DeepSeek R1 model variant based on what resources you have and what performance you need. In this walkthrough, I'm using DeepSeek R1 1\\.5B, which is the smallest version you'll find in most community runtimes.\n\nThe 1\\.5B model has, as the name suggests, 1\\.5 billion parameters. It runs really well on consumer hardware or modest cloud instances. Lower compute demands, but still delivers solid results for everyday chat and coding tasks. I was actually surprised how capable it is for its size.\n\nAs of late 2025, you've got options for larger variants in Ollama and similar runtimes too. There are several 7B and 8B options available, for instance. The larger models respond more coherently and reason better. But here's the thing, they need more memory. Let me give you a quick rule of thumb that I've learned the hard way:\n\n* CPU only with 16 to 32 GB RAM. Stick with 1\\.5B or a quantized 7B model.\n* Single mid range GPU with 16 to 24 GB VRAM. You can run 7B or 8B quantized models comfortably.\n* High VRAM GPUs. Consider the larger models if you need stronger reasoning and can handle the higher cost."

You now have a powerful AI model running under your control, on your own machine, inside your own security perimeter. Pretty cool, right?\n\n### Recap\n\n* You set up the environment by installing Ollama, MongoDB, and all the required dependencies.\n* You downloaded and configured DeepSeek R1 to run locally.\n* You set up a Chat UI and connected it to MongoDB and Ollama.\n* You made sure network access was working by opening the needed ports on AWS.\n* You accessed the chatbot from your browser.\n* Optional. You picked a GPU instance for faster responses and larger models.\n\nYour locally hosted DeepSeek R1 chatbot is now up and running. The whole process took me about 30 minutes the first time, and now I can spin one up in under 10\\.
