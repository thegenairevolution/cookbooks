        "## Introduction\nLarge language models have completely transformed how we approach natural language processing, but here's the thing - their general-purpose nature can really limit what they can do in specialized fields like legal, medical, or financial applications. I've found that customizing LLMs for domain-specific tasks is what bridges this gap, letting developers build production-ready systems that actually deliver the precision and reliability you need. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have hands-on experience implementing parameter-efficient fine-tuning, building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, designing domain-specific prompts, and deploying optimized models. And yes, everything runs in a fully executable Colab notebook.\n\nFor additional techniques on tailoring LLMs to specific use cases, explore our <a href=\"/blog/44830763/mastering-domain-specific-llm-customization-techniques-and-tools-unveiled\">guide on domain-specific LLM customization</a>.\n\n<hr>\n## Setup & Installation\nBefore we dive into the customization techniques, let's get all the necessary dependencies installed. These libraries will enable model handling, dataset management, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, vector database integration, and deployment."
