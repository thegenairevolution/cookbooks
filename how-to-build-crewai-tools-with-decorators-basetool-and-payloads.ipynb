        "When you're building intelligent agents with CrewAI, one of the coolest things you can do is hook them up to custom tools and external APIs. This completely changes the game. Instead of just having your agents generate text, they can actually *do* things. Call functions, query services, execute real actions. It opens up a whole world of possibilities for complex workflows.\n\nNow, here's the thing. Most simple tool examples you'll find online just pass a single string input. Sure, that works for basic stuff, but let me tell you, it gets limiting really fast. I learned this the hard way when I was building an agent for a side project last year. In the real world, you need your agent to handle structured data with multiple fields, optional parameters, the works. You need richer payloads if you want to interact with sophisticated APIs and internal logic in any meaningful way.\n\n![Uploaded image](/public-objects/user_insert_44830763_1763428384195.png \"Uploaded image\")**So in this post, I'm going to show you how to build smarter tools by:**\n\n* Using the @tool decorator for those quick, lightweight tools you need to spin up fast\n* Leveraging the BaseTool class when you need more control over structured inputs and internal logic\n* Passing a single payload attribute that cleanly carries multiple arguments into your tools. This one's particularly useful when your parameters can vary, like when you have optional fields depending on the situation\n\n## Setup\n\nFirst things first, you'll need CrewAI.

        "## Approach \\#1: Using the @tool Decorator\n\nThe @tool decorator is probably the simplest way to create a tool in CrewAI. What I like about it is that the syntax stays really close to how you'd write a regular Python function. No fancy abstractions to worry about.\n\nActually, when I first started with CrewAI, I tried to overcomplicate everything. But then I realized, sometimes simple is better.\n\nTo show you how to call a tool with several parameters (not just a simple string), let's use a practical business case. In a lot of agent workflows I've built, you often need a multi\\-step process. First step: understand and classify what the user wants. Next step: actually do something about it.\n\nFor this example, we'll focus on that first step. We're going to build a tool that receives structured information about a user and logs their intent. Think of it as setting the stage for whatever action comes next.\n\n**Creating a Simple Tool with the @tool Decorator:**"

You define your expected inputs by creating a Pydantic BaseModel, then you subclass BaseTool to build the tool itself.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind here, and this is important: your agent has to use the exact parameter names you defined in the input schema. Get those wrong and nothing works. Trust me, I spent an embarrassing amount of time debugging this once because I had typed \"user\\_name\" in one place and \"username\" in another.\n\n**Defining a Structured Tool with BaseTool and BaseModel:**"

Sometimes you don't know exactly what structure your inputs will have from one tool call to another. I discovered this while working on a personal project where the API I was calling had about fifteen optional fields. When that happens, you can define your tool to accept a single payload argument.\n\nBut here's the catch: it must be called exactly \"payload\", and it needs to be a string representation of a dictionary containing all your attributes. Not a dictionary. A string. This tripped me up for hours.\n\n**Define the tool with a single payload string argument:**"

I tested several different approaches to make this work:\n\n* First, I tried adding a detailed input explanation inside the tool definition itself. Didn't work. The agent kept passing a dictionary instead of a string, and everything would fail.\n* Then I tried adding a detailed input explanation in the task definition. Still no luck. The agent continued to format the input incorrectly.\n\nActually, wait. Let me be more specific about what was happening. The agent would literally pass `{\"key\": \"value\"}` as a Python dict object, not as the string `'{\"key\": \"value\"}'` that the tool expected. Such a small difference, but it broke everything.\n\nHere's what actually worked:\n\n* Start your task description by clearly defining how the input should be structured\n* Explicitly tell the agent in the task description that the tool only accepts an input called payload, and that payload must be a string\n* Clearly indicate which attributes are optional, so the agent knows when it can leave fields out"

Each method has its sweet spot depending on what you're trying to build.\n\nFor simple tools where you just need a few fixed inputs, the @tool decorator is your friend. It keeps your code clean and close to standard Python functions. Perfect for small utilities or when you're working with well\\-defined APIs. Honestly, I use this one probably 60% of the time.\n\nWhen you need the full package, complete control over input validation, custom error handling, or you need to manage persistent state, then subclassing BaseTool is the way to go. You get to tightly structure your inputs with Pydantic models and customize your tool's behavior exactly how you want it. This was a lot more complicated than I imagined when I first tried it, but once you get the hang of it, it's incredibly powerful.\n\nAnd finally, when your tool inputs need to be flexible, with some fields being optional depending on the situation, handling everything through a single payload argument gives you maximum flexibility. This method lets you pass dynamic data structures safely. Just remember to be crystal clear in your task description about how the agent should format that payload. I cannot stress this enough.\n\nMaster all three approaches, and you'll be able to design smarter, more reliable agents that can interact with pretty much any tool or API you throw at them. That's when things get really powerful and you can tackle real\\-world applications with confidence."
