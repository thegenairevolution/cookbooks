        "## Introduction\n\nThis guide walks you through building a multi\\-agent customer feedback analysis system with CrewAI. You'll define three specialized agents—one for sentiment evaluation, one for report summarization, and one for visualization—that collaborate in a structured workflow to process raw feedback, generate insights, and produce a final report with charts.\n\nYou'll see how to set up agents and tasks in YAML, integrate tools (in this case, a CSV file reader) for grounded analysis, validate structured outputs, and produce visualization snippets. All the code is ready to run (you can use Colab) with minimal setup.\n\nBy the end, you'll have a functioning multi\\-agent system that converts raw feedback data into reusable, structured analytical reports.\n\n## Building Blocks of Multi\\-Agent Systems in CrewAI\n\nWhen you build a multi\\-agent system, think of it like structuring a team. In CrewAI, you organize around Agents, Tasks, Tools, Crews, and Training. These are key to scaling and maintaining the system. CrewAI supports defining agents and tasks in YAML, which separates configuration from code. This makes things easier to manage and adjust over time.\n\n### Agents\n\nAgents represent roles, goals, and backstories. You define them in YAML. Each agent gets assigned tools (if needed), and memory or code permissions depending on their responsibilities. This keeps responsibilities explicit and helps reduce errors like hallucinations.\n\nIf you're interested in how agent design can be extended to more complex, stateful workflows, our guide on [building a stateful AI agent with LangGraph](link) offers a practical, step\\-by\\-step approach.\n\n### Tasks\n\nTasks are what you want agents to do. Each task has:\n\n* A description of what needs to be done\n* An expected output format\n* An agent assignment\n\nYou define tasks separately in YAML. You can have more tasks than agents—one agent may handle multiple tasks.\n\nFor a deeper dive into extracting structured information from unstructured data, see our article on [structured data extraction with LLMs](link), which explores building robust pipelines for production use.\n\n### Tools\n\nTools extend what agents can do. For customer feedback analysis, you'll want tools to read CSV files so agents can reference concrete feedback entries. CrewAI has built\\-in tools, and you can add custom ones.\n\nIf you're curious about how to optimize tool use and manage data access for agents, the [Model Context Protocol (MCP) guide](link) explains how to standardize tool and data access for reliable, auditable AI workflows.\n\n### Crews\n\nA Crew ties agents and tasks together into a workflow. You decide how agents collaborate. CrewAI supports several process types, including sequential workflows. Sequential means one task follows another. That gives you clarity in dependencies and results.\n\n## Creating a Multi\\-Agent Customer Feedback Analysis System\n\nLet's build a system that takes customer feedback data, analyzes sentiment and themes, creates summary tables, makes visualizations, and produces a final Markdown report.\n\n### Installing Requirements"

        "## Conclusion\n\nYou now have a clear example of how to use CrewAI to build a customer feedback analysis system. You defined your agents and tasks in YAML. You integrated a tool to read the CSV feedback data. You set up a workflow that moves from sentiment evaluation to report summarization to visualization and then final report assembly. The arrangement lets each part reference earlier outputs. Configuration lives outside code, so you can version control it or adjust it later.\n\nFor those looking to compare this approach with other agent architectures, you might find our tutorial on [building an LLM agent from scratch with GPT\\-4 ReAct](link) insightful, as it covers tool actions and control loops in detail.\n\nYou may want to extend this by enabling training mode so you can correct agents iteratively. Or try allowing parallel or hybrid process types if some tasks don't depend on earlier ones. If you want to go further, consider exploring structured data extraction pipelines with external tools or compare with ReAct\\-style agents trained from scratch for different trade\\-offs."
