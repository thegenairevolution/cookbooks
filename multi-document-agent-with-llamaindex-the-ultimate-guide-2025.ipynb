        "So here's what we're going to build: a multi\\-document research assistant that can actually answer questions across multiple PDFs and tell you exactly where it found the information. I've been working on this kind of system for a while now, and the key breakthrough was combining semantic vector search for those specific \"what did they say about X\" questions with hierarchical summarization for the bigger picture stuff. The whole thing uses function calling to figure out which tool to use when.\n\nBy the time you're done with this tutorial, you'll have a working notebook that handles cross\\-document Q\\&A, gives you proper citations in \\[file\\_name p.page\\_label] format (which honestly took me way too long to get right the first time), and includes some basic tests to make sure everything's working.\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n* Python 3\\.10\\+\n* OpenAI API key\n* 2 to 3 sample PDFs (research papers, reports, technical documents, whatever you have)\n* Expected cost: about $0\\.10 to $0\\.50 per summary\\-heavy query, depending on how big your documents are\n\n## Why This Approach Works\n\n**Per\\-Document Tool Isolation**\n\nEach PDF gets its own vector and summary tool. Sounds simple, but this is actually crucial. It prevents the system from mixing up information between documents, makes citations precise, and lets the agent figure out which document to look at for any given question. Plus, when something goes wrong (and it will), debugging is so much easier when everything's cleanly separated.\n\n**Semantic Tool Retrieval**\n\nHere's something I learned the hard way: when you have more than a handful of documents, you can't just throw all the tools at the agent and hope for the best. Instead, we use an object index that embeds tool descriptions and retrieves the top\\-k relevant ones for each query. Works beautifully even with dozens of documents.\n\n**Dual Retrieval Strategy**\n\nVector tools handle the narrow stuff. \"What dataset did the authors use?\" That kind of thing. Summary tools handle the broad synthesis questions. \"Compare the main contributions across papers.\" The agent picks which one based on what you're asking. I've found this combination covers about 95% of research queries.\n\n**Citation Enforcement**\n\nEvery tool attaches file name and page metadata to its results. Then the system prompt basically hammers into the agent that it needs to cite sources after each claim. You can also post\\-process responses to clean up the citation format if needed. No more vague \"according to the document\" nonsense that drives everyone crazy.\n\n## How It Works (High\\-Level Overview)\n\n1. **Load and chunk PDFs** – Extract text, split into chunks that respect sentence boundaries, normalize all the metadata for citations.\n2. **Build per\\-document tools** – Create both vector and summary tools for each PDF, give them clear descriptions so the agent knows what they do.\n3. **Index tools semantically** – Embed those tool descriptions in an object index so we can retrieve them dynamically.\n4. **Assemble the agent** – Use function calling with a pretty strict system prompt to route queries and make sure citations happen.\n5. **Validate and iterate** – Run test queries, see which tools get selected, adjust retrieval thresholds and temperature until it works right.\n\n## Setup \\& Installation\n\nFirst things first, let's install everything with pinned versions so we don't run into compatibility issues later:"

        "## Conclusion\n\nAnd there you have it. You've built a multi\\-document research assistant that routes queries to the right tool, pulls out precise passages, and actually tells you where it got the information from.\n\nThe key decisions that make this work: keeping tools separate per document for clean attribution, using semantic retrieval to scale beyond a handful of documents, and having two retrieval modes. Vector for the specific stuff, summary for the big picture.\n\nIf you want to take this to production, here's what I'd do next:\n\n1. **Persist indices** – Save those vector and summary indices to disk or something like pgvector or Pinecone. Re\\-embedding everything on every run gets expensive fast. Learned that one the hard way.\n2. **Add retries and rate limits** – Wrap your LLM calls with exponential backoff and timeouts. Things fail. Better to handle it gracefully than crash.\n3. **Implement structured logging** – Use LlamaIndex callbacks or a proper logging framework to track tool calls, latency, token usage. Future you will thank present you when something weird happens.\n4. **Cache answers** – Use an LRU cache or Redis for repeated queries. Actually, I wrote up [how to implement semantic cache with Redis Vector](/article/semantic-cache-llm-how-to-implement-with-redis-vector-to-cut-costs-6) if you want to get fancy with it and save some serious API costs.\n5. **Post\\-process citations** – Extract source\\_nodes from responses and format citations programmatically. Relying purely on prompts for formatting only gets you so far. Sometimes you need to just fix it in post.\n\nThat's pretty much it. You now have a working multi\\-document research assistant that knows where its information comes from. Pretty handy for any serious document work where you need to back up your claims."
