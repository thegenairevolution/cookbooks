        "So here's the thing about the Model Context Protocol (MCP): it lets you define tools, resources, and prompts just once, then expose them to any MCP\\-capable client out there. We're talking CLIs, agents, chatbots, you name it. Instead of constantly rewriting the same tool logic for every single application (which, let's be honest, gets old fast), you build one server that clients can discover and invoke automatically.\n\nI'm going to walk you through building a minimal Python MCP server over stdio. We'll test it with a client and make sure everything actually works. By the time we're done, you'll have a working server that exposes math tools, static documentation, and a prompt template. You can run this in a notebook or just fire it up in your local terminal, whatever works for you.\n\nIf you want the full picture of how MCP standardizes tool and data access, check out [Model Context Protocol (MCP) Explained.](/article/model-context-protocol-mcp-explained-2025-guide-for-builders)\n\n## Why Use MCP for This Problem\n\nWhen I first started thinking about sharing tools across multiple applications, I quickly realized there were several approaches, each with their own headaches.\n\nYou could go with a **shared Python package**. But then every app needs to import and maintain the exact same library version. And forget about runtime discovery or schema negotiation, that's just not happening.\n\nMaybe a **bespoke HTTP microservice**? Sure, but now you're dealing with network overhead and custom API design. Plus you still don't have standardized tool metadata.\n\nWhat about **OpenAI\\-native tools defined per app**? Well, now you're duplicating tool definitions everywhere. You completely lose that single source of truth.\n\nOr **agent\\-framework\\-specific tools**? Great until you realize you're locked into one framework API. Want to port to another framework? Time to rewrite everything.\n\nHere's where MCP actually solves these problems:\n\n* **Automatic discovery**: Clients can list available tools, resources, and prompts right at runtime. No guesswork.\n* **Standardized schemas**: JSON Schema definitions mean you get consistent validation and documentation everywhere.\n* **Transport abstraction**: Whether it's stdio, SSE, or WebSocket, clients and servers negotiate capabilities without you having to build custom protocols.\n\n\nCentralizing these capabilities in one server just makes sense. It removes all that repetition. Clients discover and invoke standardized functionality automatically. And honestly, if you're worried about those subtle bugs that tokenization quirks can cause, you should really read [Tokenization Pitfalls: Invisible Characters That Break Prompts and RAG](/article/tokenization-pitfalls-invisible-characters-that-break-prompts-and-rag-2). You might also want to consider [implementing reliable vector store retrieval for RAG](/article/rag-101-build-an-index-run-semantic-search-and-use-langchain-to-automate-it).\n\nThe beauty of a single MCP server is that you have one place to update logic and metadata. One schema for validation. Consistent behavior across all your apps. But remember, LLM context isn't infinite memory. If you're planning to scale prompt sizes or chain calls, definitely check out [Context Rot \\- Why LLMs \"Forget\" as Their Memory Grows](/article/context-rot-why-llms-forget-as-their-memory-grows-3).\n\nActually, if you're curious about comparing MCP with a workflow\\-first approach, take a look at [building robust LLM workflows with LangChain](/article/langchain-101-build-your-first-real-llm-application-step-by-step). It's a nice complement to this pattern, showing you how to orchestrate tools and prompts in a structured pipeline.\n\n## Core Concepts for This Use Case\n\nBefore we start building anything, let me break down these MCP primitives.\n\n**Tools** are basically functions that the client can invoke with typed arguments. The server executes them and sends back results. Pretty straightforward.\n\n**Resources** are static or dynamic data identified by URI. Clients read them on demand as text, JSON, or binary, whatever you need.\n\n**Prompts** are these reusable templates that generate messages for LLM conversations. Clients fetch them and render them with arguments.\n\nThe **stdio transport** is what we'll use here. Server and client communicate over standard input and output. Honestly, it's the simplest option for local development and subprocess integration.\n\nAnd then there's **schema negotiation**. The server advertises tool input schemas with JSON Schema and resource MIME types. Clients validate input and adapt automatically, which is really nice.\n\nIf you're still getting the hang of crafting effective templates and roles, you might want to see [best practices for prompt engineering with LLM APIs](/article/prompt-engineering-with-llm-apis-how-to-get-reliable-outputs-4). It'll help you get consistent results from your MCP prompts.\n\n## Setup\n\nFirst things first, make sure you have Python 3\\.9 or later. I always create a clean virtual environment to avoid those annoying dependency conflicts. You'll need to decide whether you're running this in a notebook or in a terminal. If you're using a notebook, just make sure you can write files to the working directory.\n\nInstall the required packages in a notebook cell or terminal:"

        "This gets you the MCP SDK, an async runtime, and an OpenAI client. I'd recommend pinning versions for reproducibility. If the installation fails, check your Python version and virtual environment first, then give it another shot. Oh, and if you're thinking about operating your stack outside managed services, you might want to consider [deploying a self\\-hosted LLM server](/article/how-to-run-a-self-hosted-llm-on-your-server-practical-guide-2025-2) to pair with your MCP server.\n\n## Using the Tool in Practice\n\n### Build the MCP Server\n\nLet's create a server that exposes two math tools, a static markdown resource, and a prompt template. I'm using stdio transport here because, well, it's simple.\n\nPick a filename for the server. I usually go with something like mcp\\_server.py. If you're working in a notebook, use whatever file writing utility your environment provides. Terminal users, just fire up your preferred editor.\n\nWrite the server to a file using a notebook cell:"

        "So what's happening here? The @server.tool() decorator registers async functions as tools. The client gets JSON Schema for each tool, which means it can validate arguments before calling. The @server.resource() decorator exposes static or dynamic data by URI. Clients read the content using the resource URI, and the server returns the body with a MIME type. The @server.prompt() decorator defines those reusable prompt templates I mentioned. A prompt can define named input variables, message roles, and a message sequence. The whole thing runs over stdio, reading requests from stdin and writing responses to stdout.\n\nAs you're building, keep these things in mind:\n\n* Each tool needs a clear JSON Schema for inputs. This is what helps clients validate before execution.\n* Each resource should return a stable URI and the correct content type. Otherwise clients won't render content correctly.\n* Each prompt should declare required arguments and message roles. Clients need to know what variables to supply.\n\n### Test the Server with a Client\n\nNow let's create a separate file for the client. Call it mcp\\_client.py or just reuse a notebook cell. The client will start the server as a subprocess and connect over stdio.\n\nWrite a client that connects to the server, lists capabilities, calls a tool, reads a resource, and fetches a prompt:"

        "Use safe\\_call\\_tool instead of calling session.call\\_tool directly. I'd start with a conservative timeout. Only expand it if you confirm that a tool actually needs more time. Always log errors and return structured error information to whoever's calling.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nLet me save you some time with common issues I've run into:\n\n**The client cannot discover tools**: Make sure the server process actually starts correctly. Check that the stdio transport isn't buffered or redirected somewhere weird. Confirm the working directory contains the server file.\n\n**JSON Schema validation errors**: Double\\-check that your tool input matches the schema. Look at required fields, types, and enum values. If your arguments are valid but the schema is too strict, update the tool schema.\n\n**Resource not found**: The resource URI needs to match exactly. If the server builds resource URIs dynamically, print the final URI and compare it to what the client is requesting.\n\n**Prompt rendering errors**: You need to pass all required variables. If your template variables change, update both the server prompt declaration and the client call.\n\n**Hanging calls**: Add timeouts using that resilience pattern I showed you. If a tool depends on external services, handle network retries and backoff inside the tool implementation itself.\n\n**Version conflicts**: Pin your dependencies and reinstall in a fresh virtual environment. Make sure the client and server are using compatible MCP SDK versions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nSo there you have it. You've built a minimal MCP server that exposes tools, resources, and prompts over stdio, and you've verified it works with a test client. This pattern lets you define capabilities once and reuse them across any MCP\\-compatible application. You now have a repeatable way to standardize tool access without constantly rewriting code for each app.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nHere's what I'd tackle next:\n\n**Integrate with OpenAI function calling**. Convert MCP tools to OpenAI tool schemas and route calls from GPT\\-4 to your server. There's a separate guide for this. For deeper customization, check out the [step\\-by\\-step guide to fine\\-tuning large language models](/article/fine-tuning-large-language-models-a-step-by-step-guide-2025-6).\n\n**Add dynamic resources**: Instead of just static markdown, serve real\\-time data like database queries or API responses.\n\n**Explore other transports**: Try SSE or WebSocket for remote or browser\\-based clients.\n\n**Package and deploy**: Containerize your server and expose it through a network transport for multi\\-user access."
