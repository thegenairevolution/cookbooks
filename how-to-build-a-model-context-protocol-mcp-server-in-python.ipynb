        "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) lets you define tools, resources, and prompts once and expose them to any MCP\\-capable client. This includes CLIs, agents, and chatbots. Instead of rewriting tool logic for each application, you build a single server that clients discover and invoke automatically.\n\nThis guide walks you through building a minimal Python MCP server over stdio. You'll test it with a client and verify that tools, resources, and prompts work as expected. By the end, you'll have a working server that exposes math tools, static documentation, and a prompt template. You can run it in a notebook or a local terminal.\n\nFor a comprehensive overview of how MCP standardizes tool and data access, see [Model Context Protocol (MCP) Explained.](/article/model-context-protocol-mcp-explained-2025-guide-for-builders)\n\n## Why Use MCP for This Problem\n\nWhen you need to share tools across multiple applications, you have several options.\n\n* **Shared Python package**: Every app must import and maintain the same library version. You get no runtime discovery or schema negotiation.\n\n* **Bespoke HTTP microservice**: You add network overhead and custom API design. You also lack standardized tool metadata.\n\n* **OpenAI\\-native tools defined per app**: You duplicate tool definitions in every codebase. You lose a single source of truth.\n\n* **Agent\\-framework\\-specific tools**: You get locked into one framework API. Porting to another requires rewriting.\n\nMCP solves these problems by providing:\n\n* **Automatic discovery**: Clients list available tools, resources, and prompts at runtime.\n\n* **Standardized schemas**: JSON Schema definitions ensure consistent validation and documentation.\n\n* **Transport abstraction**: Stdio, SSE, or WebSocket. Clients and servers negotiate capabilities without custom protocols.\n\nCentralizing these capabilities in one server removes repetition. Clients can discover and invoke standardized functionality automatically. If you want to avoid subtle bugs caused by tokenization quirks, read [Tokenization Pitfalls: Invisible Characters That Break Prompts and RAG](/article/tokenization-pitfalls-invisible-characters-that-break-prompts-and-rag-2), and consider [implementing reliable vector store retrieval for RAG](/article/rag-101-build-an-index-run-semantic-search-and-use-langchain-to-automate-it).\n\nA single MCP server gives you one place to update logic and metadata. You get one schema for validation and consistent behavior across apps. Keep in mind that LLM context is not infinite memory. If you plan to scale prompt sizes or chain calls, see [Context Rot \\- Why LLMs \"Forget\" as Their Memory Grows](/article/context-rot-why-llms-forget-as-their-memory-grows-3).\n\nIf you want to compare MCP with a workflow\\-first approach, explore [building robust LLM workflows with LangChain](/article/langchain-101-build-your-first-real-llm-application-step-by-step). It complements this pattern by showing how to orchestrate tools and prompts in a structured pipeline.\n\n## Core Concepts for This Use Case\n\nBefore building, let's understand these MCP primitives.\n\n* **Tools**: Functions the client can invoke with typed arguments. The server executes and returns results.\n\n* **Resources**: Static or dynamic data identified by URI. Clients read them on demand as text, JSON, or binary.\n\n* **Prompts**: Reusable templates that generate messages for LLM conversations. Clients fetch and render them with arguments.\n\n* **Stdio transport**: Server and client communicate over standard input and output. This is the simplest option for local development and subprocess integration.\n\n* **Schema negotiation**: The server advertises tool input schemas with JSON Schema and resource MIME types. Clients validate input and adapt automatically.\n\nIf you're new to crafting effective templates and roles, see [best practices for prompt engineering with LLM APIs](/article/prompt-engineering-with-llm-apis-how-to-get-reliable-outputs-4). It will help you get consistent results from your MCP prompts.\n\n## Setup\n\nConfirm you have Python 3\\.9 or later. Create a clean virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts. Decide whether you'll run in a notebook or in a terminal. If you use a notebook, make sure you can write files to the working directory.\n\nInstall the required packages in a notebook cell or terminal:"

This example uses stdio transport for simplicity.\n\nDecide on a filename for the server. For example, you can name it mcp\\_server.py.

        "The @server.tool() decorator registers async functions as tools. The client receives JSON Schema for each tool, so it can validate arguments before calling. The @server.resource() decorator exposes static or dynamic data by URI. Clients read the content using the resource URI, and the server returns the body with a MIME type. The @server.prompt() decorator defines reusable prompt templates. A prompt can define named input variables, message roles, and a message sequence. The server runs over stdio, reads requests from stdin, and writes responses to stdout.\n\nAs you build, keep these checks in mind:\n\n* Each tool should define a clear JSON Schema for inputs. This helps clients validate before execution.\n\n* Each resource should return a stable URI and a correct content type. This helps clients render content correctly.\n\n* Each prompt should declare required arguments and message roles. This helps clients supply all needed variables.\n\n### Test the Server with a Client\n\nCreate a separate file for the client. You can name it mcp\\_client.py or reuse a notebook cell.

Always log errors and return structured error information to the caller.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n* **The client cannot discover tools**: Ensure the server process starts correctly. Check that the stdio transport is not buffered or redirected. Confirm the working directory contains the server file.\n\n* **JSON Schema validation errors**: Verify that your tool input matches the schema. Check required fields, types, and enum values. Update the tool schema if your arguments are valid but the schema is too strict.\n\n* **Resource not found**: Confirm the resource URI matches exactly. If the server builds resource URIs dynamically, print the final URI and compare it to the client request.\n\n* **Prompt rendering errors**: Make sure you pass all required variables. If your template variables change, update both the server prompt declaration and the client call.\n\n* **Hanging calls**: Add timeouts using the resilience pattern. If a tool depends on external services, handle network retries and backoff inside the tool implementation.\n\n* **Version conflicts**: Pin your dependencies and reinstall in a fresh virtual environment. Confirm that the client and server rely on compatible MCP SDK versions.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYou built a minimal MCP server that exposes tools, resources, and prompts over stdio, and you verified it with a test client. This pattern lets you define capabilities once and reuse them across any MCP\\-compatible application. You now have a repeatable way to standardize tool access without rewriting code for each app.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n* **Integrate with OpenAI function calling**. Convert MCP tools to OpenAI tool schemas and route calls from GPT\\-4 to your server. This is covered in a separate guide. For deeper customization, see the [step\\-by\\-step guide to fine\\-tuning large language models](/article/fine-tuning-large-language-models-a-step-by-step-guide-2025-6).\n\n* **Add dynamic resources**: Serve real\\-time data like database queries or API responses instead of static markdown.\n\n* **Explore other transports**: Use SSE or WebSocket for remote or browser\\-based clients.\n\n* **Package and deploy**: Containerize your server and expose it through a network transport for multi\\-user access."
