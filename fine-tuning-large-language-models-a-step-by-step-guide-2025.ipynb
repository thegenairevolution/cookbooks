        "So you've been working with an LLM and the first thing you tried was probably prompt engineering. You write clear prompts, follow the [Guidelines to Effective Prompting](https://thegenairevolution.com/harnessing-the-power-of-llm-apis-a-guide-to-effective-prompting/), try to be direct. For complex stuff, you ask the model to reason step by step. If you want a complete guide on [building production\\-ready LLM features with prompt engineering](/article/prompt-engineering-with-llm-apis-how-to-get-reliable-outputs-4), I put together something that covers pretty much everything.\n\nBut sometimes that's not enough. I've been there. So you try in\\-context learning. Like I explained in [The Magic of In\\-Context Learning](https://thegenairevolution.com/the-magic-of-in-context-learning-teach-your-llm-on-the-fly/), you basically add examples to help the model understand what you want. For more on [in\\-context learning techniques](/article/the-magic-of-in-context-learning-teach-your-llm-on-the-fly-3), check out my practical guide. Saved me countless hours.\n\nIf that still doesn't work, it's probably time for fine\\-tuning. This is where things get interesting. I covered this in [Fine\\-Tuning 101](https://thegenairevolution.com/fine-tuning-101-how-to-customize-llms-to-your-specific-needs/). Fine\\-tuning lets you customize the LLM for your specific use case. Depending on your resources and needs, you can do full fine\\-tuning or parameter\\-efficient fine\\-tuning. You might want to explore [approaches like LoRA](/article/parameter-efficient-fine-tuning-peft-with-lora-2025-hands-on-guide-2) to reduce costs while keeping performance strong. Actually, LoRA was a game\\-changer for some personal projects where GPU memory was tight.\n\nIn this cookbook, I'll focus on full fine\\-tuning. I'll walk you through how to apply it step by step. Let me show you what worked for me.\n\n## Setup\n\nLet's set up our environment. I'm following the same setup from [Running an LLM Locally on Your Own Server: A Practical Guide](https://thegenairevolution.com/running-an-llm-locally-on-your-own-server-a-practical-guide/). Check that post if you need detailed instructions. Getting the setup right saves so much headache."

        "When our task is requesting city information, including name, country, population, and landmarks, in\\-context learning hits its limit. We're not getting what we want. I spent hours trying different prompts before accepting we needed more. Time for fine\\-tuning.\n\n## Preparing the Training Data\n\nHere's what I'm going to do: use another LLM, a larger one, to create training data. I'll generate 100 labeled input\\-output pairs for fine\\-tuning, then see if that's enough.\n\nThis method is great for generating datasets quickly. Saves tons of time. But you need to make sure the data is accurate and diverse. I learned this the hard way when I didn't validate generated data properly. The model learned some weird patterns.\n\n### Advantages of Using an LLM\n\n* **Speed**: An LLM generates thousands of examples in minutes. I once needed 500 examples for a personal project. Got them done during lunch.\n* **Consistency**: The model ensures consistent formatting across your dataset. No more worrying about semicolons versus commas in example 47\\.\n* **Adaptability**: You can adjust prompts for more diverse outputs. Want different question phrasing? Add facts about different countries? Just tweak and regenerate.\n\n### Process Using GPT\\-4\n\n**1\\. Define a Template for the Desired Output**\n\nCreate a template for the question\\-answer pairs you want. For cities, include fields like name, country, population, landmarks. I start simple then refine based on what the model produces.\n\n**2\\. Provide Few\\-Shot Examples to the LLM**\n\nUse few\\-shot learning to guide the model. Start with manually written examples, prompt the model to generate more in the same style. Be specific about what you want.\n\n**3\\. Use the LLM to Generate Multiple Examples**\n\nWith your template and examples ready, the LLM can generate more pairs. Use API calls, loop over geographic entities, generate what you need. Actually, wait. Don't generate everything at once. I do batches of 20\\-30 to check quality.\n\n**4\\. Review and Refine the Data**\n\nLLMs produce structured outputs, but quality varies. You need to review for:\n\n* **Accuracy**: Check facts like capitals, populations, landmarks. GPT\\-4 once told me the Eiffel Tower was in Berlin. These things happen.\n* **Format Consistency**: All answers follow the template\n* **Diversity**: Include various questions and phrasing. You don't want 100 examples starting with \"Tell me about...\"\n\nTo improve quality, you might explore [techniques for building RAG systems and managing datasets](/article/rag-101-build-an-index-run-semantic-search-and-use-langchain-to-automate-it). These help curate and validate training data."

That's a win.\n\nFine\\-tuning offers a powerful way to tailor models to specialized tasks. Makes your model more effective. But you need to review data and outputs for accuracy and diversity.
