        "In an earlier post, we went through [how to build a knowledge graph using Neo4j](/article/how-to-build-a-knowledge-graph-rag-pipeline-with-neo4j-embeddings-2) and add semantic search capabilities to really boost a retrieval\\-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. We looked at extracting structured entities and relationships from messy unstructured content, getting everything into a graph database, and then doing hybrid retrieval with both vector embeddings and graph queries. If you want to dig deeper into making retrieval work better, check out our guide on [retrieval tricks to boost answer accuracy in RAG pipelines](/article/rag-application-7-retrieval-tricks-to-boost-answer-accuracy-2).\n\nHere's what I've discovered about knowledge graphs and large language models like GPT\\-4o. They actually complement each other really well. I was honestly surprised at how good these models are at turning natural language into Cypher queries. And when you give them a clear picture of your graph schema, with all the nodes and relationships laid out, they can reason through it pretty effectively. What this means for you is that you can literally ask questions about your data in plain English, and the model just... gets it. It translates your question into these powerful graph queries almost without thinking about it. If you're thinking about expanding to handle multiple documents and more advanced retrieval, our guide on [building multi\\-document agents for advanced retrieval and summarization](/article/multi-document-agent-with-llamaindex-the-ultimate-guide-2025-2) has everything you need to know.\n\n![Uploaded image](/public-objects/user_insert_44830763_1763667388200.png \"Uploaded image\")\n\nSo let's take this to the next level. I'm going to show you how to build an interactive chatbot interface using Chainlit and GPT\\-4o that lets you have actual conversations with your graph database. We'll pass in conversation history, format the knowledge graph context so the LLM understands it properly, pull out the Cypher from the response, run the query, and then return results as both natural language answers and visual charts. By the time we're done, you'll have a fully working conversational interface for your Neo4j knowledge graph.\n\n## Setup\n\nFirst, let's get the required packages installed. Just run this command:"

        "## Step 3: Create Your Agent\n\nTime to set up the agent and its tasks using the standard CrewAI format. This agent is going to be responsible for understanding what users are asking and generating the right Cypher queries to pull data from the knowledge graph. If you want to see how this fits into bigger multi\\-agent systems and more complex workflows, take a look at our [practical lessons from building multi\\-agent systems with CrewAI and LangChain](/article/practical-lessons-from-building-multi-agent-systems-with-crewai-and-langchain).\n\n### Create the agents.yaml file\n\nWhen I was designing the agent prompt, I had a few specific strategies in mind to make sure the LLM would work effectively. Let me walk you through what actually worked:\n\n* **Expertise framing**: We tell the agent it's an expert analyst who knows Neo4j inside and out and can explain results clearly.\n\n* **Resilience**: The agent doesn't give up. If a query doesn't work, it tries different approaches until it finds the data.\n\n* **Polite tone**: Every response needs to be courteous, professional, and actually helpful to the user.\n\n* **Cypher guidance**: This one's important. We specifically tell it to use WITH instead of SQL\\-style GROUP BY to avoid common mistakes.\n\n* **Schema awareness**: We give it the complete graph structure, all the nodes, properties, relationships, everything. That way it can generate accurate Cypher queries."

You've got multiple tables, complex relationships everywhere. And while large language models can theoretically generate SQL, in practice? They often struggle to consistently produce queries that actually work. I've run into this problem more times than I can count in various projects.\n\nNeo4j and knowledge graphs offer a really powerful alternative. Even when you have a complex schema with tons of different node types and relationships, LLMs like GPT\\-4o are surprisingly good at generating correct Cypher queries. And they do it consistently. Actually, the more I think about it, combining this with semantic search gives you the best of both worlds. You get all the flexibility of a vector database plus the structured querying power of a relational database. And it's all wrapped up in a conversational interface that anyone can use.\n\nIf you want to make your chatbot even more effective, consider using [in\\-context learning techniques to improve LLM responses](/article/the-magic-of-in-context-learning-teach-your-llm-on-the-fly-3)."
